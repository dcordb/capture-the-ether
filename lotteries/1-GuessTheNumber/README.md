## Challenge

In this challenge we have the guess in the code, the guess is equal to 42. We
just need to interact with the contract.

## Solution

In this challenge we just have to do a transaction to call the function `guess`
passing the value 42 as a parameter.

To do this, we can use the Remix IDE, copy the code of the contract and compile
it, to get its ABI. Then we can use the deploy plugin of Remix to start the
transaction.
