## Solution

In this challenge we just have to do a transaction to call the function `guess`
passing the value 42 as a parameter.

To do this, we can use the Remix IDE, copy the code of the contract and compile
it, to get its ABI. Then we can use the deploy plugin of Remix to start the
transaction.
